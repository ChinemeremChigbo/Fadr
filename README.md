# Fadr

Fadr is an innovative hair clipping system that leverages the gyrosycope and accelerometer data from Airpod Pros and from an iPhone to accurately determine the orientation of both your head and the clippers. This information allows the clippers to automatically adjust their cutting height, eliminating the need for different guards.

Users can select from a variety of hairstyles within the Fadr app. Once a hairstyle is chosen, the app determines the appropriate cutting heights and directs the clippers to adjust accordingly. This system enables anyone to achieve professional-quality haircuts at home, ranging from simple trims to complex fades, without requiring barber expertise.
